👋 Hi, I’m Abhijit.

👀 I’m passionate about Data Engineering, Statistical Inference, and AI-assisted Development, with recent experiments spanning LangGraph agents, Kedro pipelines, and NASA MODIS (MOD11) climate data.

🌱 Currently exploring Deep Learning for Sequence Modeling, Human-AI collaboration, and production-grade Python stacks (Kedro + FastAPI + Reflex).

⚙️ Recent builds: Rayden Rules — an AI-assisted climate intelligence platform using NASA satellite data; semantic layer modeling for sales data; agentic SQL orchestration.

💞️ Open to collaborating on Machine Learning, LLMOps, Data Architecture, and Optimization (LP/MILP) projects.
